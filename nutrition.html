          Eating Well: The Best Food for Your Pet Bird
        </h1>
        <p class="article">
          What do I feed my pet bird? That’s a question we hear every day. The ideal avian diet is much more than birdseed and parrot pellets. Parrots, finches, canaries and other companion birds require a varied, nutritious diet, which can include seeds, but also pellets and fruits and vegetables. In order to feed pet birds properly — which gives them the building blocks for feather production, healthy skin and a happy attitude — they should have a buffet of healthy options. But how can you take care of your avian friend's dietary needs?

          The Base Diet for Birds: Food That Is Balanced
        </h1>
        <p class="article">
          In the wild, birds eat a vast variety of foods: seeds, nuts, grasses, flowers, fruits, insects, the list goes on. The change in seasons brings new types of foods, and birds nourish themselves on what’s available. At home, your bird also nourishes himself on what’s available, so it should ideally be the most balanced, natural and whole food possible. A bird’s diet is critical to his health. A bird on a poor diet will not live out his full life span, and will most likely succumb to any number of viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. A good diet boosts the immune system and helps the bird ward off illness. Not only that, a good diet keeps a bird in good spirits, keeps his feathers in great condition, and improves his life overall.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          The “base” diet is the primary item that you feed your bird on a daily basis; everything else you feed is an addition to the diet, or may even be considered a “snack.” Ideally, the base diet should be as nutritionally sound as possible because it is what your bird is eating the most. Lafeber products are the ideal base diet because they are formulated to be nutritionally balanced. Every bite your bird takes offers building blocks for all of the systems of the body. They are also fun for your bird to eat and are packed with a wide variety of healthy, nutritious, non-GMO ingredients, most of which your bird would search out in the wild.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          The base diet — whether it’s Nutri-Berries, Avi-Cakes, Pellet-Berries or Premium Daily Diet Pellets, or a combination of these — should be offered in the morning when the bird is hungriest. If the bowl is empty later in the evening, you can add more. Don’t allow your bird’s bowl to be empty for too long. Small birds, especially, have a very fast metabolism and most choose to eat all day long.

          Fruits & Veggies: Great Snack for Parrots, Finches & Canaries
        </h1>
        <p class="article">
          Fruits and veggies make great daily snacks, especially the more nutritious fruits and veggies, such as those that are dark green or orange in color. Try various fresh foods to see what your bird likes the best. If you have a picky pet bird, offer fresh foods in a variety of ways: chopped, mashed, whole, grated, and so on. Don’t give up too soon on feeding a certain nutritious item; it may take a while for your bird to get curious enough to try it.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          When you feed fresh foods, make sure that they only stay available to the bird for a few hours. After that, many fruits and veggies start to go sour or attract pests. Here’s a short list of some nutritious fruits and veggies you can try. Make sure to rinse everything very well before serving them to your pet bird, and use organic produce whenever possible.

          Avian veterinarians often recommend dietary supplementation for “seed junkies,” those birds that refuse to touch anything other than seeds. If your bird is eating Lafeber products, you have much less to worry about, because these diets are nutritionally complete. Still, you may have a bird that is molting, laying eggs, or recuperating from an illness or injury, or perhaps your bird is stressed from a recent move, loss of a mate or other stressful situation. In these cases, you should consider a dietary supplement to keep your bird in tip-top shape.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          Also, just as you may sometimes take vitamins, it’s often good for a bird to have a vitamin and mineral supplement just to make sure that he is getting the nutritional elements he needs to remain healthy. Speak with your avian veterinarian about dietary supplementation before you start giving them to your pet bird. You can harm your bird by over-supplementing, but it can’t hurt to offer a supplement a couple of days a week. If you add a powdered supplement to the water, change the water at least twice a day, and offer only fresh water (without the supplement) at night to ensure that bacteria doesn’t grow in the dish.
