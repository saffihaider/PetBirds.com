# PetBirds.com

An HTML based static webpage for the CS50X: Web Programming course

This website is dedicated to pet birds, and features a photo gallery of common bird species as well as a blog detailing pet care tips. This project was my first time using HTML and CSS, and I spent much time learning Bootstrap to give the site a modern, professional feel.
